# Beep-Beep
Beep Beep is a traffic system builder and simulator created by students for Dr. Vikash Gayah of Penn State University. The project primarily utilizes Unity to create a program which allows a user to create and manipulate a traffic system in order to better understand how traffic works in a simple and easy to use context. The work done on this project was done through STATEWARE (Students Taking Advantange of Their Education While Advancing Research Efforts), a class that aims to simulate an industry environment while creating vital tools for researchers on campus.
