Anyway, here is the documentation for the route choice model.

Let i be an index for each route that is available between an OD pair.
Let c_i be the cost or impedance of traveling on that route (for now, I recommend using travel distance)
 
The probability of taking route i =   where   is a positive scale parameter that the user should be able to select / modify.
 
Using these probabilities, each vehicle should randomly select one of the paths. The higher the probability, the more likely that path should be selected.
